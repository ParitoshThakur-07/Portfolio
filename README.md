I have made a Portfolio website with the help of HTML, CSS and JS.
In this website, I have added Resume, Navigation buttons and a typedJS feature too to make it look visually appealing.
The navigation buttons will take you to the part of the website you've clicked.
I have also added sections like About me, Services, Work Experience, Contact me. It was really fun to explore different features of Web development while making this website.
